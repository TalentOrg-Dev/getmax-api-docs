# GetMax API Terms of Use
Hello and welcome! If you’re reading this, chances are you’re interested in developing software for use with our application programming interface (“GetMax API”). We’re glad you’re here and can’t wait to see what you come up with. Here are the terms of use for our API.

**Do I have to agree to these terms of use?** If you want to use the API, yes. We’re offering use of the API only on the terms posted on this page. By using the GetMax API, you’re agreeing to follow them. So, if you don’t agree to any of the terms, GetMax doesn’t grant you a license to use the API.

**For how long can I use the API?** Your license to the GetMax API continues until it’s ended by you or GetMax.

**How would the license end?** Either party can end the license any time for any or no reason. If you want to end the license, just stop using the GetMax API. That will end the license. If you violate any of the terms below, your license to use the API terminates automatically and right away. If GetMax sends you a written notice terminating your license, that also terminates your license right away.

**How can I stay up to date on the terms?** We might update these terms from time to time. But we’ll keep up-to-date terms at this URL and save each version on GitHub.

## 1. Licensed Uses and Restrictions.
GetMax owns the GetMax API. GetMax licenses it to you on these terms.

- You can use it anywhere in the world.
- Your use is non-exclusive, so others can use it too.

GetMax hosts user generated content (“UGC”) such as text or images. UGC is owned by the users (or someone who allowed them to use it) and not by GetMax. You agree to use UGC only in ways authorized by the user who posted it, such as providing attribution or otherwise complying with Creative Commons licenses.

Here are things you can’t do:

- Sell, lease, or sublicense the GetMax API or access to it.
- Use the GetMax API for any application that substantially replaces the core user experience of GetMax’s website or apps.
- Do anything that could mislead users into thinking you’re offering a replacement for GetMax or that you or your product are endorsed or created by GetMax.
- Use the GetMax API to spam or harass anyone.
- Participate in any “follow” or “recommend” exchange program.
- Use the GetMax API to post automatically generated content to GetMax, including posts, follows, recommends, or responses not initiated by a GetMax user.
- Conceal your identity or your application’s identity when requesting authorization to use the GetMax API.
- Cache or store any UGC or user data except for the reasonable period necessary to provide your service.
- Use the GetMax API for any application that is spyware, adware, or any other malicious software, or is used in connection with any such software.
- Use the GetMax API in a way that violates the law or any person’s rights, including intellectual property and privacy rights.
- Use GetMax as a generic image hosting service for banner advertisements, graphics, or similar.
- Use the GetMax API in a way that undermines the stability of GetMax’s servers or the behavior of other applications using the GetMax API. GetMax may rate limit or block applications that make a large number of calls to the API that aren’t primarily in response to direct user actions.

By accepting these terms, you agree to comply with the [GetMax Terms of Service](https://app.getmax.ai/terms). GetMax reserves all rights not expressly granted in these terms.

## 2. Trademark.

You may use the GetMax word mark or logo in connection with the GetMax API as approved by GetMax. You agree to seek prior approval in writing from GetMax before any use of GetMax’s logo or word mark.

## 3. Relationship of the Parties.

GetMax has certain rights in the API under the laws of the U.S. and other countries. GetMax’s rights apply to the GetMax API and all its output and executables. You agree to abide by all applicable proprietary rights laws.

These terms don’t implicitly grant you rights in any intellectual property owned or licensed by GetMax. The only such rights you receive under these Terms are those explicitly granted.

## 4. Support.

GetMax may choose to provide you with support or modifications for the GetMax API in its sole discretion. GetMax may change, suspend, or discontinue any aspect of the GetMax API, including such support or modifications, at any time without notice or liability.

## 5. Fees.

GetMax is currently providing you the API for free.

## 6. Disclaimer of Warranty.

GetMax’s providing the API to you as is. That means it doesn’t come with any warranty, express or implied. No implied warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, availability, security, title or non-infringement.

We’ve made this API as reliable as possible. But the GetMax API probably won’t be perfect. So, we’re telling you now, it might have bugs, inaccuracies or interruptions.

You use the GetMax API at your own discretion and risk.

## 7. Limitation of Liability.

GetMax won’t be liable to you for any damages that arise from using the API. This includes all of types of damages (indirect, incidental, consequential, special or exemplary). And it includes all kinds of legal claims, such as breach of contract, breach of warranty, tort, or any other loss.

## 8. Release and Waiver.

You release and waive all claims against GetMax to the maximum extent permitted by law. This means all types of claims, damages, costs and expenses arising from your use of the GetMax API. This includes all claims against any of GetMax’s subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, licensors, co-branders or other partners, and employees.

If you’re a California resident, you waive your rights under California Civil Code 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.”

You understand that you or GetMax might later find out that a fact relating to this release is different than what we now believe. You accept and assume the risk of such possible differences in fact.

You expressly waive all rights and benefits you may have under any other source of law of similar effect, to the fullest extent permitted by law.

## 9. Indemnity.

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to indemnify GetMax against any third-party claim arising from or related to your use of the GetMax API. This indemnity obligation to GetMax includes GetMax’s subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, licensors, co-branders or other partners, and employees. This indemnity obligation includes any liability or expense arising from all claims, losses, damages (actual and/or consequential), suits, judgments, litigation costs and attorneys’ fees. GetMax will work in good faith to give you written notice of any such claim.

## 10. General Terms.

**Relationship of the Parties.** You and GetMax are acting independently of each other. Neither will act as partner, joint venturer, agent, employee or employer of the other. You won’t have any express or implied authority to create or assume any obligation for GetMax or on behalf of it.

**Severability.** If any provision of these terms is found invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, You and GetMax agree that the court should try to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision and that other provisions of these will remain in full effect.

**Forum and Choice of Law.** These terms are governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions. You and GetMax agree that any suit arising from these terms must take place in a court located in San Francisco, California.

**No Waiver of Rights.** If GetMax doesn’t exercise any right it has under these terms, any such inaction doesn’t waive the applicable right or provision.

**Interpretation.** These terms may not be construed against either party.

**Entire Agreement.** These terms are the entire agreement between GetMax and you concerning GetMax’s API.
